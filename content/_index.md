# Vikram Saraph

Hey, I'm Vikram! I am a software engineer at the [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab](https://www.jhuapl.edu/), with a strong background in mathematics and a focus on building practical and scalable software systems. I think of myself first and foremost as an engineer; I like to understand how things work and how to build things that work well.

I earned my [PhD in Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/media/filer_public/7c/91/7c91fc0e-9b03-45c9-95a6-1b59b11a9b14/saraphvikram.pdf) and [Master in mathematics](https://graduateschool.brown.edu/academics-research/distinctive-opportunities/open-graduate-education/open-graduate-education-alumni) from Brown University, and my bachelor's degrees in the same fields from the University of Notre Dame. Before joining JHU/APL, I worked at Meta as a research scientist, where I helped scale neural network [training](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/cpr-understanding-and-improving-failure-tolerant-training-for-deep-learning-recommendation-with-partial-recovery/) and [inference](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/deeprecsys-a-system-for-optimizing-end-to-end-at-scale-neural-recommendation-inference/) for Facebook’s mobile app ads system.

While my zeal for mathematics has been a lifelong driving force, I’m most interested to how math can shape our understanding of real-world problems. That perspective originally led me into machine learning, and it continues to guide my work today as I build systems that bridge research and production.

I enjoy learning new things, whether that's exploring a new technology stack, tackling an unfamiliar research area, or collaborating with people from different disciplines. You can find more about my professional background on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vsaraph/) profile, and some of my earlier academic work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=90n7RmsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) or [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/152/3578.html).

In my free time, I like to hike, bike, travel, [solve puzzles](https://www.puzzles.wiki/wiki/Team_Providence), play [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/vsaraph), and read. I listen to a [lot of music](https://www.last.fm/user/vsaraph), go to the occasional concert, and like transcribing music by ear. I also have aspirations of [blogging](/blog).
