# Vikram Saraph

I am currently a software engineer and AI/ML researcher at the [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab](https://www.jhuapl.edu/). I have a [PhD in Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/media/filer_public/7c/91/7c91fc0e-9b03-45c9-95a6-1b59b11a9b14/saraphvikram.pdf) and [Master in mathematics](https://graduateschool.brown.edu/academics-research/distinctive-opportunities/open-graduate-education/open-graduate-education-alumni) from Brown University, and a bachelors degree in the same two fields from the University of Notre Dame. I was also a research scientist at Meta, where I studied how to scale [training](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/cpr-understanding-and-improving-failure-tolerant-training-for-deep-learning-recommendation-with-partial-recovery/) and [inference](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/deeprecsys-a-system-for-optimizing-end-to-end-at-scale-neural-recommendation-inference/) of neural networks in Facebook's mobile app ads pipeline. Though I don't publish much these days, some of my prior work is available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=90n7RmsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/152/3578.html).

My expertise in and zeal for mathematics has long been a driving force in my career, though today I find that I am most passionate about bridging theory and practice by building systems that apply state-of-the-art
research. To that end, I enjoy working with reseachers across a variety of domains and developing scalable software solutions that make their vision a reality.

I've served in various roles during the course of my career, including as technical lead on software projects,
as principal investigator
on research projects, and as an individual contributor developing software, training machine learning
models, and doing data science. Recent application domains include information operations, homomorphic encryption, and audio/video processing.

I am a lifelong learner and am not afraid to tackle problems
in unfamiliar domains and pick up new technologies along the way. Some of my latest professional work and technical competencies are described on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vsaraph/) profile. I sometimes write about things that I tinker with or read about in my free time on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/vikramsaraph.com), and I used to be more active on [Math StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/82388/vikram-saraph) when I did more math during my academic career.

Outside of work, my hobbies include hiking, traveling, [solving puzzles](https://puzzledpint.com/") (having been on [Team Providence](https://www.puzzles.wiki/wiki/Team_Providence") since 2015), playing [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/vsaraph), and reading. I also listen to a [lot of music](https://www.last.fm/user/vsaraph) (particularly indie rock), go to the occasional concert, and like transcribing music by ear. I also have aspirations of [blogging](/blog).
