# Vikram Saraph

Hey, I'm Vikram! I am a software engineer and AI/ML researcher at the [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab](https://www.jhuapl.edu/). I have a [PhD in Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/media/filer_public/7c/91/7c91fc0e-9b03-45c9-95a6-1b59b11a9b14/saraphvikram.pdf) and [Master in mathematics](https://graduateschool.brown.edu/academics-research/distinctive-opportunities/open-graduate-education/open-graduate-education-alumni) from Brown University, and a bachelors degree in the same two fields from the University of Notre Dame. I was a research scientist at Meta, where I studied how to scale [training](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/cpr-understanding-and-improving-failure-tolerant-training-for-deep-learning-recommendation-with-partial-recovery/) and [inference](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/deeprecsys-a-system-for-optimizing-end-to-end-at-scale-neural-recommendation-inference/) of neural networks in Facebook's mobile app ads pipeline. I don't publish much these days, though some of my prior work is available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=90n7RmsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/152/3578.html).

My zeal for math has long been a driving force in my career, though today I find that I am most passionate about building systems that apply state-of-the-art research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I enjoy working alongside reseachers across various problem domains, and developing scalable software solutions that have immediate, real-world value and impact.

I am a lifelong learner and am not afraid to tackle problems in unfamiliar domains and pick up new technologies along the way. Some of my latest professional work and technical competencies are described on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vsaraph/) profile. I am on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/vikramsaraph.com), and I used to be active on [Math StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/82388/vikram-saraph) when I did more math during my academic career.

In my free time, I like to hike, bike, travel, [solve puzzles](https://www.puzzles.wiki/wiki/Team_Providence), play [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/vsaraph), and read. I listen to a [lot of music](https://www.last.fm/user/vsaraph), go to the occasional concert, and like transcribing music by ear. I also have aspirations of [blogging](/blog).
