    <div class="post-title">Spindown Dice</div>

    I've recently been dabbling in Magic: The Gathering.
    <a
      href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/05/07/135482/magic-the-gathering-is-officially-the-worlds-most-complex-game/">It's
      a hard game</a> with a long history and a ton of cards. In Magic, players often use 20-sided dice, or d20s, to
    decrement (or increment) counters that track numbers in the game such as life points.
    An ordinary d20 doesn't have consecutive numbers adjacent to one another, which makes it inconvenient to use for
    counting, so spindown d20s were invented. These dice do have consecutive numbers appearing next to one another,
    so that players can easily decrement or increment counters using these dice.

      blog post</a> talks more about spindown d20s.

    A d20 is geometrically an icosahedron, which is one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">five
      different Platonic solids</a>. The first thing I think of, though, when I see an icosahedron
    like a d20, is that it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex">simplicial complex</a>.
    In two and three dimensions, simplicial complexes are essentially
    shapes assembled from triangles (also called simplexes). Simplicial complexes
    generalize to higher dimensions, but that's outside the scope of this post.

    (If you're reading this and have better solutions for rendering or visualizing simplicial complexes, let me know,
    because
    I still haven't found anything satifying to me. In this post, I've used <a
      href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, PowerPoint, hand drawings, and
    physical objects
    to visualize them, and I've previously used matplotlib as well.)

    <br><br>

    I've spent a lot of time studying simplicial complexes. And so to me, the spindown property of a d20 seems a whole
    lot like
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelling_(topology)"><i>shellability</i></a>
    property of simplicial complexes, which
    informally states that a simplicial complex can be put together in a nice order. More specifically, imagine that we
    piece
    together the complex one triangle at a time. Then shellability requires that each time a new triangle is attached,
    the triangle must attach only along edges, not vertices. Topologists and combinatorialists care about shellable
    complexes since they are well-behaved and generally have other nice properties.

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="images/spindown/shellability.png" class="image" width="60%">
      <p class="image-caption">A shellable complex with a shelling order (left), and a complex that isn't shellable
        (right).</p>
    </div>

    I've always been curious about why this property is called shellability, but I'd guess it's meant as an analogy with
    <a
      href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50106d5684aed4702b7242ed/1586870153920-P3OAI3Y6LFCHM1QZV0S8/image-asset.jpeg">shelling
      an egg</a>. The faces of a spindown die are naturally ordered by the numbers 1 through 20, so we could "shell"
    the dice in this same order.
    But is this actually a shelling order? The answer to this question is "yes", and it's easy to see if one has a
    spindown d20 handy. Each
    time one attaches a triangle with the next number, one can verify that it attaches only along edges. But there are
    many other
    hypothetical
    spindown orders on d20s. We could number a d20 in many different ways that spins down from 20 to 1. Are all of these
    also shelling
    orders?

    <br><br>

    One could be very patient and list all possible spindown orders of a d20 and check whether this is true. But
    there are many such spindown orders, and listing them all would be a challenge in itself. We're instead going to
    show
    by contradiction that all spindown orders are also shelling orders, by assuming that there's a spindown order on a
    d20 that
    isn't a shelling order.

    <div class="section-heading">Spindown orders <i>are</i> shelling orders (...on a d20)</div>

    So suppose we have a spindown order that isn't a shelling order. Then in the spindown order, at some point,
    we must attach a triangle, calling it \(B\) that (1) <b>attaches along a
      vertex</b> so that shellability is violated. But being part of a spindown order, it must (2) <b>also be attached
      to an edge of an existing
      triangle</b> (calling this triangle \(A\)). Let's refer to the sequence of triangles we have already attached via
    spindown order as the <i>path</i> \(P\) that we've built so far, up to and including \(A\) (but not \(B\)).

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="images/spindown/path.png" class="image" width="25%">
      <p class="image-caption">An example path \(P\) (colored in red), and \(B\) in green.</p>
    </div>

    An icosahedron is an regular polyhedron, which means that all faces are symmetric with one another. That means
    it doesn't matter which adjacent pair of triangles \(A\) and \(B\) that we choose on the icosahedron to make our
    argument; they're all the same. Let \(v\) be the vertex that \(B\) intersects with, and consider all neighboring
    triangles (one of which is \(B\)).

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="images/spindown/nbd.png" class="image" width="25%">
      <p class="image-caption">The neighborhood of \(v\) contains all possible next triangles for \(P\).</p>
    </div>

    Triangles \(X\) and \(Y\) could not already be in \(P\), otherwise \(B\) would not intersect \(P\) along a
    vertex. This leaves three possibilities: either \(C\), or \(D\), or both, are part of \(P\). We'll start with the
    case that \(C\) and \(D\) both belong to \(P\), and see that it's impossible to reach both X and Y while maintaining
    the spindown order property.

    <br><br>

    The path \(P\) is itself a simplicial complex, and by our assumption that \(B\) is the <i>first</i> added triangle
    that violates shellability, \(P\) is shellable. As stated above, shellability gives us some nice properties, and in
    this case,
    it lets us prove that \(P\) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractible_space"><i>contractible</i></a>.
    Contractibility roughly means we can deform it into a
    point,
    or into other contractible shapes like a simple curve. Below is an example of how we can deform a path of triangles
    into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_chain">piecewise linear curve</a>.

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="images/spindown/deform_path.png" class="image" width="25%">
      <p class="image-caption">Deforming a path of triangles to a 1-dimensional curve.</p>
    </div>

    Similarly, the single triangle \(B\) can also be deformed to a line. The intersection of \(B\) and \(P\) is a line
    segment
    and a point, which deforms to two points. And the whole icosahedron can be deformed into a sphere. Visualizing all
    of this,
    we're basically creating a loop on the surface of the d20 at exactly the moment that \(B\) is added to \(P\).

    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="images/spindown/sphere.png" class="image" width="25%">
      <p class="image-caption">Adding \(B\) to \(P\) creates a topological loop on the surface of the d20.</p>
    </div>


    This loop cuts
    the sphere into two
    hemispheres,
    with \(X\) on one hemisphere and \(Y\) on the other. If we want to continue adding triangles to \(P\), we would
    either
    have to choose \(X\) or \(Y\), after which the other is unreachable. This means that \(P\) cannot be extended to a
    spindown
    order on the whole d20, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore all spindown orders must be shelling
    orders. We started with the assumption that \(C\) and \(D\) were both part of \(P\), but the same topological
    reasoning works if only one of them is part of \(P\).

    <div class="section-heading">Spindown orders <i>are not</i> shelling orders (generally)</div>

    This begs the question: if we generalize the concept of "spindown order" to other simplicial complexes, are spindown
    orders <i>always</i> shelling orders? The answer to this is "no", and a counterexample is a fairly simple
    triangulation
    of a square. Illustrated below are examples of a spindown order that isn't a shelling order, and also a shelling
    order that is not a spindown order.


    <div class="image-wrapper">
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/spindown/shelling_not_spindown.png" width="50%">
        <p class="image-caption">Shelling order that isn't a spindown order.</p>
      </div>

        <p class="image-caption">Spindown order that isn't a shelling order.</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    In the above, the ordering on the left hand side isn't a spindown order, since consecutive numbers aren't edge
    adjacent (for example, 12 and 13).
    The right hand side isn't shellable because when we attach triangle 14, it intersects with the rest of the complex
    at the red vertex.

    <br><br>

    The difference between this complex, versus the d20, is that in the above spindown order, we're able to trace along
    the boundary of the square when we create a loop, so we aren't actually separating the remaining space into two
    disconnected regions by attaching along a vertex. We can't do this with a sphere since it has no boundary.

    <br><br>

    The argument above used reasoning specific to an icosahedron,
    though I think one can change this proof a bit to generalize to <i>any</i> triangulation of a sphere (an icosahedron
    is one of these). The argument above can also be made more rigorous by turning the handwaved "deformations" into
    actual <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HomotopyEquivalence.html">homotopy equivalences</a>.

    <div class="section-heading">Can we use a computer to solve this problem?</div>

    I think this is reasonably doable, and I might update this post on another day with some code.
    <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a> is a computer algebra system
    with a lot of useful mathematical features. It has <a
      href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/topology/sage/topology/simplicial_complex.html">simplicial
      complexes</a> implemented, and even a function that lets one instantiate the <a
      href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/topology/sage/topology/simplicial_complex_examples.html#sage.topology.simplicial_complex_examples.FareyMap">icosahedral
      complex</a>
    directly. It also lets one compute the flip graph of a
    simplicial complex. It has an extensive graph library, and includes a function that computes a Hamiltonian path for
    a given graph.

    <br><br>

    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path">Hamiltonian path</a> of a graph is one that traverses all
    vertices in a graph exactly once, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_graph">flip graph</a> is a
    graph
    that encodes edge-adjacencies of a the complex's faces.
    If you squint just a bit, you can see that a spindown order on a simplicial complex is "just" a Hamiltonian path on
    its flip graph.
    I would want to use SageMath to exhaustively (or, as exhaustively as we can) enumerate all Hamiltonian paths on the
    flip
    graph of the icosahedral complex (this is the dodecahedral graph; the icosahedron and dodecahron are <a
      href="https://www.math.brown.edu/tbanchof/Beyond3d/chapter5/section03.html">dual</a>), and for each path, verify
    that it's a shelling order. This would be one way of brute-forcing an answer to the question: we'd expect to find no
    counterexamples.
    At the very least, it would give one more confidence about the assertion that spindown orders on a d20 and shelling
    orders.

    <br><br>

    One thing I'm also curious about is whether the above proof can be formalized using a proof assistant such as <a
      href="https://lean-lang.org/">Lean</a>.
    The answer is probably "yes", but doing so is well beyond my current level of expertise with proof assistants.
