  <main> <h2 id="what-is-oeis">What is OEIS?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://oeis.org/">On-Line Rncyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a> (OEIS) is exactly what it <a href="https://oeis.org/listen.html">sounds</a> like: it’s a searchable database of interesting number sequences. It’s used by math researchers to discover sequences that they might encounter during their research, and it can help them find other relation sequences or relevant citations to published papers.</p>
<p>Each entry in OEIS consists of several terms in the sequence, along with other associated data, like formulas or recurrence relations that define the sequence, programs that generate the sequence, and references to related OEIS sequences. <a href="https://oeis.org/A000045">Here&rsquo;s the entry</a> for the Fibonacci sequence. You can read more about OEIS on their <a href="https://oeis.org/FAQ.html">FAQ page</a>.</p>
<p>OEIS has been around for nearly three decades (as of this writing), has over 300,000 sequences, and grows at a rate of a few dozen new sequences per day. Most interesting sequences have been found and added to OEIS by now, so it’s not some major accomplishment to find a new one. But I accidentally came across a sequence while not doing any kind of research; I discovered it while chatting with an amateur mathematician (who will remain anonymous) in a gaming Discord server who was messing with tic-tac-toe-like grids and their arrangements. I submitted <a href="https://oeis.org/A378907">the sequence</a> to OEIS, went through the review process, and got it accepted and published. So I thought I’d write about this sequence and the submission process.</p>
<h2 id="the-number-sequence">The number sequence</h2>
<p>The inspiration for the following sequence came from a minigame in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a>, called <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Chocobo_World">Chocobo World</a>. In it, you control a character called Boko, exploring a world where you fight enemies. There’s a level-up mechanism where a magic stone is randomly placed into a 3x3 grid after each battle. Boko levels up when a row, column, or diagonal is completed, so if you’re lucky, you can level up him with as few as 3 stones, or if you’re unlucky, it takes as many as 7. Here&rsquo;s a video of a gamer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIAbD7J2bRk&amp;t=588s">testing playing Chocobo World</a>, leveling up Boko, and here&rsquo;s a screenshot from the game of what the 3x3 grid looks like with a complete diagonal of stones:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p>The first question asked was how many ways there are place 6 stones into a 3x3 grid without leveling up. This isn&rsquo;t hard to reason about; there are only two ways to do this:</p>

      </figcaption>
  </figure>

</div>
<p>Naturally, and especially if you’re a combinatorialist who likes to count things, the next question is then how many ways are there of doing this in the general \(n \times n\) case. That is, how many ways are there of placing the maximum (\(n^2 - n\)) number of stones (or abstractly, <em>items</em>) in an \(n \times n\) grid so that no row, column, or diagonal is complete? Let’s call this sequence \(A(n)\) for all integers \( n > 0 \).</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;d first thought about this sequence, what came to mind were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_matrix">permutation matrices</a>. These are binary matrices that have exactly one 1 in each row and column. Here are two \(4 \times 4\) examples:</p>
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]<p>and would correspond exactly to arrangements of our \(n \times n\) with no complete row or diagonal, where 1s encode the <em>lack</em> of a item placed in a slot, or &ldquo;hole&rdquo;. This reasoning is incomplete since it doesn’t account for the grid&rsquo;s diagonal or anti-diagonal, but it did give me a starting point to enumerate the sequence via code. This is the code I originally wrote to generate \(A(n)\) by enumeration over all permutation matrices:</p>

It takes less than 5 seconds to obtain the sequence \(1, 0, 2, 10, 48, 270, 2004, 15406, 144656\). <a href="https://oeis.org/search?q=1%2C+0%2C+2%2C+10%2C+48%2C+270%2C+2004%2C+15406%2C+144656&amp;language=english&amp;go=Search">Searching OEIS with these terms</a> previously yielded no search results, though now you&rsquo;ll get <a href="https://oeis.org/A378907">A378907</a>, which is the subject of this blog post.</p>
<p>I did try to find a closed-form expression or recurrence relation for \(A(n)\), but the best I could do in the limited time that I had was to count the number of grid arrangements with no complete row, column, or <em>single</em> diagonal (disregarding the anti-diagonal). Let&rsquo;s call the number of such arrangements \(A'(n)\). These are the permutations that are also not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement">derangement</a>s; a derangement \(\sigma\) is a permutation that has no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics)">fixed point</a>, so there is no \(i\) such that \(\sigma(i) = i\). If you look at the binary matrix representing a derangement \(\sigma\), the matrix could not have any elements on its diagonal, because if it did, then \(\sigma\) would fix the corresponding element and not be a derangement. Therefore \(A'(n)\) is exactly the number of permutations on \( n \) that are not derangements. The number of derangements \( D(n) \) for a given \( n \) is a well-studied sequence and is <a href="https://oeis.org/A000166">on OEIS</a>. The number of derangements on \( n \) is called the \(n\)th <em>subfactorial</em>, sometimes denoted \( ! n \). So \(A'(n) = n! - !n\).</p>
<p>If we defined an “anti-derangement” (this isn&rsquo;t standard terminology, I just made this up) as something complementary to a derangement, so that \( \sigma (i) \ne n + 1 - i \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \), then by symmetry, the number of anti-derangements for a given \( n \) is exactly the number of derangements. An anti-deragement would correspond to a permutation matrix that doesn&rsquo;t have any 1s along its anti-diagonal. If we had a way of counting the number of permutations \( B(n) \) that are both derangements <em>and</em> anti-derangements, then \( A(n) = n! - 2 \cdot !n + B(n) \). But I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to compute \( B(n) \). Instead, another OEIS user pointed me to a sequence for \( B(n) \) after my submission for \( A(n) \).</p>
<h2 id="the-submission-process">The submission process</h2>
<p>At the encouragement of a Bluesky user, I submitted the sequence to OEIS. It was easy enough to describe, but not in OEIS yet, so I thought that it should belong in the database. The submission process was relatively straightforward. The first step I had to take was registering an account with OEIS, which was slightly more effort than I expected. When signing up, I had to fill out a short bio, and proof that I was who I was claiming to be. I’d guess that this is to prevent spam or bot submissions. I ended up sending a few screenshots of my other online accounts to verify that I&rsquo;m me.</p>
<p>OEIS treats each submission as it mathematicians might a paper submission to a peer-reviewed journal, which is reasonable, since OEIS is a body of ever-growing mathematical knowledge in a very real sense. OEIS maintaining this level of integrity also means that they require authors to use their real names, and not pseudonyms, when registering an account, which unfortunately meant that I couldn’t directly credit the person I discovered this sequence with.</p>
<p>Once I had an account, I moved forward with creating a new submission. Doing this was relatively quick since I already had a few terms on hand from the Python program that I quickly wrote. I found a few other related sequence (like n! and the number of derangements), cross-referenced them, and hit send. It got added to the queue of active submissions, which can be viewed here without having to login to OEIS: <a href="https://oeis.org/draft">https://oeis.org/draft</a>. I received feedback on the submission within just a few hours, with users asking me to clarify the description of my submission. This discussion happens via comments on the submission, and in draft state, any other user can edit the submission as they see fit. This was a spectacular way to crowdsource knowledge about this new sequence: other uses were able to determine a recurrence relation for this sequence and also substantially improve the Python program that I’d submitted. They also found several other related OEIS sequences that are now cited on the published entry.</p>
<p>The entire review process happened over the course of a month before being approved and published. Interestingly, the typical OEIS user is only allowed to submit up to 3 entries in their lifetime (and used to be 7). This is to limit the volume of submissions that are received, since OEIS largely operates on donations and volunteers’ free time. You can request more, but you have to be a solid contributor for a long enough time.</p>
