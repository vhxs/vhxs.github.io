      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-algebraic-numbers&#34;&gt;What are the Algebraic Numbers?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlgebraicNumber.html&#34;&gt;algebraic numbers&lt;/a&gt; are complex numbers that are solutions of polynomial equations with integer coefficients. For example, \(\sqrt{2} \) is algebraic because it satisfies \( x^2 - 2 = 0 \), while the number \( \pi \) is not algebraic (it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number&#34;&gt;transcendental&lt;/a&gt;) since it&amp;rsquo;s not a root of any integer polynomial you can imagine. They form a subfield of the complex numbers, so they&amp;rsquo;re closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Furthermore, the rational numbers are a subfield of the algebraic numbers, since the rational number \( a / b \) is a root of the linear integer polynomial \( bx - a = 0 \).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An OEIS Sequence</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-oeis&#34;&gt;What is OEIS?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://oeis.org/&#34;&gt;On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences&lt;/a&gt; (OEIS) is exactly what it &lt;a href=&#34;https://oeis.org/listen.html&#34;&gt;sounds&lt;/a&gt; like: it’s a searchable database of interesting number sequences. It’s used by math researchers to discover sequences that they might encounter during their research, and it can help them find other related sequences or relevant citations to published papers. Each entry in OEIS consists of several terms in the sequence, along with other associated data, like formulas or recurrence relations that define the sequence, programs that generate the sequence, and references to related OEIS sequences. &lt;a href=&#34;https://oeis.org/A000045&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the entry&lt;/a&gt; for the Fibonacci sequence. You can read more about OEIS on their &lt;a href=&#34;https://oeis.org/FAQ.html&#34;&gt;FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
