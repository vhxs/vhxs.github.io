      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;blogging-and-static-site-generators&#34;&gt;Blogging and static site generators&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have a website and an online presence. My first incarnation of a (Wordpress) &lt;a href=&#34;https://markivikram.wordpress.com/about&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; from 2013 is still out there living on the Internet; it was named after &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructible_universe&#34;&gt;Gödel’s constructible universe&lt;/a&gt; since I was obsessed with the foundations of mathematics when studying theoretical computer science at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is going to read like a diary entry for how I set up a blog-ready website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been dabbling in Magic: The Gathering. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/05/07/135482/magic-the-gathering-is-officially-the-worlds-most-complex-game/&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a hard game&lt;/a&gt; with a long history and a ton of cards. In Magic, players often use 20-sided dice, or d20s, to decrement (or increment) counters that track numbers in the game such as life points.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;An ordinary d20 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have consecutive numbers adjacent to one another, which makes it inconvenient to use for counting, so spindown d20s were invented. These dice do have consecutive numbers appearing next to one another, so that players can easily decrement or increment counters using these dice. &lt;a href=&#34;https://diceenvy.com/blogs/news/what-are-spindown-dice-what-makes-them-different-and-why-does-it-matter?srsltid=AfmBOorWAOSs1xmutiEEF22WPDcBli_ps5Zg_uZKzm28AuDwHrR-KkFP&#34;&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; talks more about spindown d20s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
